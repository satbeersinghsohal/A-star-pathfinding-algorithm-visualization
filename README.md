# A Star Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals
A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is 
really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in 
detail in below sections.

## How to use it
1. Execute the main.jar file.
2. Place starting node by pressing the SNode button on upper-left corner and than click on anywhere in the grid.
3. Place Ending node by pressing the ENode button which is left to the SNode button and than click anywhere in the grid.
4. Place Obstractls by pressing left click button on the grid.
5. Press Run Button to start the algorithm.

## Features
1. Adjust speed.
2. Zoom control.
